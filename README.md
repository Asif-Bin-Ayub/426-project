# 426-project
PHYCS426 (Advanced Computational Physics) Project on the Ising Model completed in the fall of 2022. 

## Project Description
* In this project, we used the Ising model (Monte-Carlo Metropolis algorithm) to simulate a 
ferromagnetic material and studied various properties such as magnetization, susceptibility
and the specific heat.
* We confirmed the existence of a phase transition into paramagnetism and characterized the
associated Curie temperature $T_C$. 
* We then studied the effects of system size and exchange energy on the properties of the system.
* We also simulated antiferromagnetism with the Ising model and investigated the various
properties. 
* We identified the NÃ©el temperature that corresponds to phase transition into paramagnetism.
* Finally, we introduced general spin directions to the 2D Ising model, and saw how it changed 
the dynamics of the system.
