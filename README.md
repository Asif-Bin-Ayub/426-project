2D system
1.	System Size:
o	The 4 properties.
	Graphs
o	Runtime as a function of system size
	Graphs
2.	Nearest-Neighbors Interaction: 
o	nn(0), nn(1), nn(2), nn(3): Think about overcounting factor.
	Illustrating Graph 
o	The interaction strength: (Exponentially, Polynomial, etc.…)
o	The 4 properties.
	Graphs in comparison.
3.	General Spin Direction:
o	The 4 properties.
	Illustrating Graph (Gradient colors)
4.	Random System:
o	The 4 properties. 
	Graphs.

3D system
Build up on your previous results on 2D system. That would give us the best combination of modification to simulate the real behavior. 

Ask your own question
Study a well-known material, that its properties are known. And compare our results with the literature. 
Saturated magnetization*.
