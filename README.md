# 426-project
PHYCS426 (Advanced Computational Physics) Project on the Ising Model completed in the fall of 2022. 

## Project Description
In this project, we use the Ising model to simulate a ferromagnetic material and study
various properties such as magnetization, susceptibility and the specific heat. We confirm 
the existence of a phase transition into paramagnetism and characterize the associated 
Curie temperature $T_C$. We then study the effects of system size and exchange energy on 
the properties of the system.

We also simulate antiferromagnetism with Ising model and investigate the various
properties. The identify the NÃ©el temperature that corresponds to phase transition into
paramagnetism. Lastly, we introduce general spin direction to the 2D Ising model, and
see how it changes the properties.
